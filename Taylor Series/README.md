# Taylor Series & Euler's Formula

Taylor series is a way to depict a function as the infinite sum of terms consisting of derivatives of the function around a specific x.

Let’s say we want to write expansion of a function $f(x)$ about x = a.

$$f(x) = f(a) + \frac{{df(a)}}{{dx}}(x-a) + \frac{{d^2 f(a)}}{{dx^2}}\frac{{(x-a)^2}}{{2!}} + \frac{{d^3 f(a)}}{{dx^3}}\frac{{(x-a)^3}}{{3!}} + \ldots$$
